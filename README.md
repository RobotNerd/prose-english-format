# Prose Syntax - English

The Prose syntax for the English language is a way to bring aspects of
programming to the written word. It introduces syntax highlighting as
well as additional functionality to help writers visualize their stories
and catch certain mistakes immediately.

If you are write in another language, please take the ideas here and
adapt them to your language of choice! Pass along a link to the project
and it will be included here.
